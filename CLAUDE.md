If a command doesn't work or something doesn't go as expected, ask the user what to do. Do not just make decisions beyond the very explicit ones given to you

# Workflow
- CRITICAL: Never say your work is done without confirming your changes worked, if you do not know how to check your changes ask the user how you should check if your changes actually worked as intended.
- CRITICAL: Always write the intent of functions in a the comments with params in a jsdoc format. Also write the intent for any api routes in the server also in this format with the params defined. If you change a function, and there is no jsdoc, be sure to add it.
- CRITICAL: When creating api routes, always write the intention of the api route above it with the proper jsdoc. Also be sure that all requests that use 
- CRITICAL: When importing components avoiding using the whole default imported object. Where possible import only the necessary parts of the module. If the module doesn't have type definitions look for the "Definitely Typed" package, install it and use the definitions from there. If no types can be found use another package, unless the user asked specifically for that package, in which case stop, and suggest the user options, and ask what they would like to use.
- make sure that after you run a task you don't leave any dev servers running and be sure to end any you started, make sure to only clear the ports that are being used by this project.
- After changes are made to the database structure be sure to run `npx prisma db push` and `npx prisma generate`
- CRITICAL: After any changes to the code have been made, be sure to write an entry including date, time, and the intention of the code changes to the file AI_JOURNAL.md. Always add the newest entry to the top or beginning of the file. Always add the list of files that were changed, and what functions or variables were added, removed, or changed in the files. 

# Code Style
- CRITICAL - Always use typescript, even when creating module files make them mts files.
- CRITICAL - When installing npm packages make sure types are install, and if not install the DefinitelyTyped definition for that package.
- Make sure code written is verbose, name conditionals what they are checking, prioritize making it easy for someone to understand what the code is doing.
- Be sure to follow present coding conventions already established in the codebase

# Tools
- CRITICAL: To manually check or test your changes use playwright to do the driving from end to end.
- CRITICAL: When running `npm run dev` to check and see if the server is running, always do a sniff test by trying to access the homepage
- CRITICAL: Never change config files to make tests or checks pass, unless the user explicitly asks you to.
- CRITICAL: When you need a temporary directory, or a temporary file that you need to place somewhere, always use the working directory for the project, and name the temporary folder claude_tmp. NEVER create folders or files outside of the working directory, the same directory this file is in.
- use express and tsx for the backend
- When using a database use the prisma ORM
- Use MUI components were possible instead of elements with classnames.
